Kibana - A brower based log analysis tool for Logstash and ElasticSearch
Copyright 2011 Rashid Khan <flipwork #logstash irc.freenode.net>

Installation
------------
This assumes you already have a functioning logstash/elasticsearch
infrastructure, perhaps with some filters to define fields. Config
of logstash and/or elasticsearch is outside of the scope of this file

Requirements:
logstash >= 1.1.0
elasticsearch >= 0.18.0
php >= 5.2
php5-curl

Other than that, it works just like any other PHP application. Untar 
and go at it. 

Edit config.php to set your elasticsearch server. 

Notes
-----
Q: Why is there no last button?
A: ElasticSearch isn't so hot at going to the last result of a many million 
result query. 

Q: Why is this in PHP instead of Java, Ruby, etc?
A: Because PHP is what I know. Its mostly javascript anyway. If you want it in 
something else, it shouldn't be too hard to port it to your language of choice.

Q: Why do I have to set a limit on events to analyze
A: Big result sets take a long time to retrieve from elasticsearch and parse out

Q: Well then why don't you use the Elastic Search terms facet?
A: I've found the terms facet to cause out of memory crashes with large result 
sets. I don't know a way to limit the amount of memory a facet may use. Until 
there's a way to run a facet and know for sure it  won't crash Elastic Search, 
I'm going to keep analysis features implemented in PHP. I'm open to other 
suggestions though. I suggest you be careful with the Statistics mode, its more
stable than terms, but can still bite you.

Q: Why do come results not show up when I search for a string I know is in
the elasticsearch indexes?
A: If you are searching analyzed fields, which is the default in ES for string
fields, remember that they are broken down into terms.  For instance, a search
for "test" will match records containing test@bleh.com, since @ is a term
boundary and is broken down into "test" and "bleh.com".  However, this will NOT
match records containing blah@test.com because "test.com" is the full term and
you are searching for an exact match.  You would need to use test* to match both
of these records.  Note you may also want to configure the ES analyze behavior
for certain fields if this is not the desired behavior.  Helpful References:

Q: Is there any way to prevent queries which perform full index scans of my
elasticsearch cluster?
A: Yes.  Set the 'disable_fullscan' to 'true' and search terms beginning with
an elasticsearch wildcard (* or ?) will be stripped of the wildcard.

Q: Where can I get some help with this?
